                <strong>Annadaan exists</strong> to bridge the gap between <strong>food surplus</strong> and <strong>food insecurity</strong>.
                Every day, millions go hungry while tons of perfectly good food is thrown away at events and gatherings.
                <strong>We believe this is a solvable problem</strong>—and we’re here to solve it.

                Every step is coordinated in real time, with transparency and trust at the core.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Our mission is simple but powerful: <strong>No one should go hungry, and no good food should go to waste.</strong> We’re building a community where compassion meets action, and where food becomes a force for good.

              With every meal saved and shared, our community is turning compassion into real change. <br />
              From weddings to large events, surplus food now finds its way to those who truly need it. <br />
              Our volunteers and partners work tirelessly to make sure no plate goes to waste. <br />
              Every act of giving creates a ripple — reducing hunger, saving food, and spreading hope. <br />
              Together, we're not just feeding people — we're building a more caring and sustainable future.
